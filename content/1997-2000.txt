Federation (hereinafter referred to as “Federation”) to negotiate
the said Charter of Demands on behalf of the workmen of the
Factory and Offices at Adugodi, Bangalore. Further, a Charter of

Dear Sir,

Management Proposals
This is further to our letter dated 04.04.1997.

With the globalisation of the economy, the customer is becoming
choosy, discreet and demanding day by day. Technology
upgradations implemented with considerable investments must be
complemented by enhanced employee productivity to optimise and
retain our competitive edge. This is possible only when employees
bring out their best through shared goals of excellence at work.

In order to cope with the emerging Scenario, we have to shed our
traditional postures and strive to meet customers’ expectations of
quality, on time delivery and cost in a highly competitive market.
We must ensure uninterrupted production, increased individual and
overall productivity together with total quality of our products and
services.

While the Charter of Demands, placed by you for a settlement, will
add to the wage costs, it must be remembered that in the context of
increasing competition, reducing tariffs & customs duties, fast
changing business environment, it would not be possible to pass on
the increased costs to the customer. We must jointly commit ourselves

42

=== PAGE 49 ===

to meet these challenges by improving productivity, eliminating
wasteful practices, avoiding futile costs and bring down the cost per
unit of our. products/services.

The human resource has to play a very important role in this regard.
The workmen and union have to co-operate in:
Improvement in employee productivity
Optimum capacity utilisation
bringing down absenteeism
reduction of wastage _
elimination of unproductive activity and wasteful practices
flexibility in deployment and redeployment of men and
machinery
improved self-discipline, commitment and adherence to
norms of work.

With a view to strive towards the above, few concrete steps are
outlined as management's proposals and placed for consideration
and discussions along with the charter of demands placed by the
Federation.

We trust you will co-operate with us in maintaining 'MICO' to be a
competitive organisation in the long term interests of the company
and the workmen.

Thanking you,
Yours faithfully
For MOTOR INDUSTRIES CO. LTD.

ANNEXURE ‘I

‘BAN' WORKS:
1. Attendance Improvement M res:

About 300-400 workmen are chronically absenting without
pay for durations ranging from 50 to '250' days in a year. The
following steps will be taken to improve attendance.

(a) Pro-rata Allowances:

(i) Apart from ‘all inclusive salary’, all monthly allowances
shall be pro-rated and paid linked to ‘paid days’.

(ii) Similarly, annual payments such as 'LTA' & 'Medical
Reimbursement’ shall be pro-rated and paid according
to the paid days during the previous calendar year.

(b) Eligibility for EL,CL.SL:

In future to be eligible for EL, CL & SL, a workman should
have put in not less than 240 actual worked days including
EL availed in the previous calendar year.

(c) EL availing:

In future EL cannot be availed unless it is pre-sanctioned. EL
can be availed not less than 3 days on each occasion and not
more than 3 occasions in one calendar year.

Accident Benefits:

The existing accident benefit scheme is being misused by
some workmen who are taking undue advantage. About -

26,000 mandays are being lost every year whereas majority
of workmen never take accident benefits.

To prevent misuse the following steps shall be taken:

a) The scheme will be extended to cover only employment

injury i.e., arising inside factory & while on duty accidents
only.

b) The practice of paying incentive for the days of accident
leave will be discontinued.

44

=== PAGE 51 ===

National & Festival Holi :

In order to improve the plant capacity, we propose increasing
the number of working days in a year. In future only 9 days
National and Festival Holidays will be declared and observed.
Thus the factory will be able to work for additional five to
seven days in a year.

To provide flexibility to meet production & export targets,
workmen may be scheduled for work on National & Festival
Holidays, need based.

Instead, workmen will be credited with 7 days leave, which
can be availed by applying in the leave card, at the choice of
the workman or encashed at his preference at the end of the
calendar year. No carry forward facility available for this leave.

However, in the event of government directing or amending
the National & Festival Holidays Act, in future, providing for |
more holidays than existing nine days, the leave credit of 7
days herein proposed shall be proportionately reduced and
adjusted as National & Festival Holidays.

Transfers:
Transfer procedure shall be reviewed to result in flexibility

~ of deployment/redeployment of manpower according to
company's needs, within Ban Works.

Employee Productivity Improvement:

To achieve the required production, workmen in Direct
incentive areas will be required to increase production
quantities by 20% over and above existing individual
efficiency levels of normal working hours. Similar efforts are
called from other than direct incentive area workmen also.

Multi-Skilled Workforce:

In order to meet competition by improving machine
utilisation and flexibility of deployment on various jobs, the
concept of Multi-Skilled Workforce shall be introduced.

MTM VT:
MIM based VTs for all processes/operations, whether
existing or new shall be implemented.

45

=== PAGE 52 ===

Unproductive Workmen: ,

Workmen who.are not contributing to the company,
adequately proportionate to their earnings, and benefits
drawn by them, as manifested by their low efficiency/
performance, poor attendance, indifferent attitude to work
and are negligent or indisciplined as assessed by the
Departmental Heads shall be declared as unproductive
workmen.

After identifying, they shall be counselled. Given an
opportunity to improve. Finally, if they don't show
improvement, unproductive workmen will be retired
compulsorily.

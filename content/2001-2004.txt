SHORT RECITAL OF THE CASE

The Management and the workmen of the Factory and offices of Motor Industries
Co. Ltd., at Adugodi, Bangalore represented by the MICO Employees' Association,
Bangalore (Regd. No. 147) had entered into a long term Settlement dated 19”
August 1998 under Section 12 (3) of The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the
Rules made thereunder and the said Settlement was to remain in force and binding
on the parties till 31° December 2000 and even thereafter, until validly terminated by
either party, by a notice as provided in The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (as
amended) & Rules made thereunder.

The MICO Employees' Association, Bangalore (Regd. No. 147) (hereinafter referred
to as “MEA"”) terminated the above Settlement by its letter dated 24.11.2000 and
thereafter, submitted a Charter of Demands vide letter dated 02.03.2001 to the
Motor Industries Co. Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as “Company”). A copy of the said
Charter of Demands is enclosed hereto and marked as Annexure I. The
Management also submitted a few proposals to MEA, aimed at improving the overall
competitiveness of the BanW Plant & various offices situated in the complex, vide
their letters dated 16.07.01 & 02.08.01. These were further clarified elaborately vide
their letter dated 03.01.02. Copies of the said letters containing the Management
proposals placed as counter demands is enclosed and marked as Annexure II.

The Management explained that in the past few years, the automobile industry has
undergone a significant change. New green field projects set up by the global major
players are able to enjoy tremendous cost advantage. Import duties have been
reduced. Monsoon has been unpredictable, limiting the growth of tractor industry.
Infrastructure projects & core sector performance has not shown significant growth.
Together, all these have affected the fortunes of the automobile industry. There have
been sharp fluctuations in demands for its various products. Fluctuating demands
have resulted in under-utilisation of Company's fixed assets during parts of the year.
Company can no longer depend on high volumes, as it did in the past. This has
necessitated the Company to take a re-look at its existing practices and policies. To
remain competitive, the Company needs to reduce its operation costs, improve
quality and enhance employee productivity.

Management further explained that the demand for ‘inline pumps! (main product)
may fall, with advent of EURO Il & Ill norms. The plant needs to prepare itself

=== PAGE 7 ===

with a progressive approach to manufacture of new generation products, which
calls for heavy investments. This will require a new work culture, on the part of
workmen and MEA.

The MEA after presenting the Charter of Demands has consistently argued
that the workmen have been working sincerely, meeting both quantity & quality
parameters. They have co-operated in all aspects in the path of the progress
adopted by the Company. However, Workmen are put to severe hardships
financially, due to ever rising cost of living in Bangalore City. The Union has
also pointed out that number of workmen covered under the settlement has
reduced from 5322 in 1997 to well under 3000 in 2003. Further, the Union &
Workmen have come forward to improve employee productivity by VT cut/
Productivity Improvement. They have also agreed to accommodate a few
management proposals. Hence, the workmen expect a ‘substantive increase’ in
wages & other benefits.

After around 30 odd meetings, held in very cordial atmosphere, the parties were
able to arrive at an amicable understanding in respect of several of the
Demands raised by MEA, as well as, some of the Management proposals.
However, there remained a few issues unresolved on certain important
demands/proposals. In the overall interest of industrial peace and harmonious
relations, the Management vide their letter dated 20.05.02, sought the
intervention & assistance of State Conciliation Officer & Labour Commissioner,
Karnataka. The Management requested him to seize the matter into conciliation
and to commence the conciliation process with a view to bring about a fair
and reasonable settlement, amicably. Accordingly, the matter was admitted
into conciliation by the authority and the same was registered under reference
IDA-2:CR-39:2002-03.

The authority held over 15 tripartite meetings on different dates, commencing from
05.06.02. The MEA decided to seek fresh mandate from its workmen members.
Unfortunately, Com. S Suryanarayana Rao, President, MEA expired in Hospital on
01.07.02, due to heart attack in the midst of the election process. Both parties
place their respects on record for the significant contribution made by the
departed leader. Thereafter, MEA elected new leadership in the elections.

During the course of conciliation meetings held with the new leadership of the
MEA, the Management on 08.12.02, finally offered a sum of Rs.1500/- pm, per

=== PAGE 8 ===

workman, as basket amount increased with effect from 01.01.2001. A sum of
Rs.125/- pm, per workman, was offered as prospective basket amount increase.
The hourly rate of incentive for a workman in GOS wage category was to be
increased from Rs.25.85 per saved hour to Rs.31.17 per saved hour. Further, a sum
of Rs.280/- pm, per workman, payable prospectively, was offered as 'Productivity
Allowance’ subject to fulfillment of agreed productivity improvement linked to
FAE, after applying 15% VT cut. As a 'package' the above benefits were offered,
subject to other Management proposals, as discussed & agreed. The Management
expressed that further improvement in the package is not possible.

Under the circumstances, with both parties sticking to their respective stands,
the authority concluded the conciliation proceedings as having “ended in failure”
on 08.12.02 and accordingly, submitted ‘failure’ report to the Government.
At this stage, the Hon'ble Minister for Labour, Karnataka, was requested to
intervene in the matter to explore the possibility of bringing about an amicable
settlement using his good offices. The Hon'ble Labour Minister held two
rounds of meetings, and finally, the Hon'ble Labour Minister advised that
while there was a need to improve employee Productivity, the Management
may consider improvement of financial package. The Management finally on
06.01.03, offered a sum of Rs.1500/- pm, per workman, retrospectively
w.e.f., 01.01.01 as basket amount increase and Rs.210/- pm, per workman, as
prospective amount increase. The Union in return agreed for 15% VT cut/
Productivity Improvement and other Management proposals, as discussed &
agreed. The hourly rate of incentive was revised from Rs.25.85 per saved hour
(GO5 Wage Category) to Rs.33.17 per saved hour. In the meeting
held on 06.01.03, in the chambers of the Hon'ble Labour Minister, the parties
signed the Minutes of the Meeting to arrive at a Memorandum of Understanding.
In line with the said Minutes of the Meeting, the parties agreed that they will sign
a Memorandum of Settlement before the Authority, soon after completing the
traditional practice of seeking mandate of workmen members by the Union.

A 'YES' or 'NO' secret ballot Referendum was held on 17.01.03, in terms
of the above minutes, to ascertain views of the workmen regarding the
"package of benefits’ offered and Management proposals accepted by the
Union. A majority of workmen voted 'NO'. Consequently, the Union conducted
fresh elections once again, for all the posts on 19.03.03.

=== PAGE 9 ===

The newly elected Office Bearers of the MEA requested Management to resume
bipartite discussions, in view of the results of Referendum and the election verdict.
The newly elected MEA leadership repeatedly emphasized that the Management
should come forward and revise its 'package’, respecting the aspirations of the
workmen. To honour the same and with a view to arrive at an amicable settlement,
the Management resumed bi-lateral discussions with the MEA. The Management
further improved the offer, over and above the level of Memorandum of
Understanding dated 06.01.03, by a sum of Rs.110/- per month (Rs.10/- in
Retrospective Basket and Rs.100/- in Prospective Basket) and also agreed to revise
the VT cut downwards from 15% to 14.5%. There was no change in the incentive
rate per hour as above.

However, MEA did not agree to the revised offer made by the Management and
resorted to agitation by boycotting Sunday Overtime w.e.f. 25.05.03, resorting to
'go-slow' w.e.f. 04.06.03, followed by '24 hour relay hunger strike’ and finally
resorted to indefinite strike w.e.f. 23.06.03. The Management once again
requested the Labour Commissioner and the State Conciliation Officer, for his
kind intervention and assistance. Accordingly, the matter was admitted into
conciliation afresh under registration reference No.IDA2-CR/47/03-04 by the
Additional Labour Commissioner (IR), paving the way for conciliation proceedings.

In the meanwhile, Labour Department, Government of Karnataka, based on the
‘failure report' submitted to them earlier by the Authority, referred the dispute for
adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal, Bangalore, by its Order of Reference
SI. No. KAE 285 KY KA 2002 dated 17.06.03.

In the conciliation meeting held on 23.06.03, the State Conciliation Officer
& the Additional Labour Commissioner (IR) advised both the parties to give up
their rigid stand and discuss the matter in the overall interests, with a view
to find an amicable solution. With a view to break the deadlock and to
end the strike, which was adversely affecting Company's business from
23.06.03, the Management held several bipartite meetings and attended
conciliation meeting, without prejudice to the fact that the matter is referred for
adjudication to the Industrial Tribunal. In the meeting held on 26.06.03, the parties
have finally reached an amicable understanding, which is acceptable to both
the parties. They have recorded the same as “Summary of Understanding”

=== PAGE 10 ===

which they agree and undertake, shall form the basis to arrive at a Memorandum
of Understanding and subsequently, Memorandum of Settlement to be signed
before the authorities. The parties have also agreed to submit a suitable joint
application to the Hon'ble Industrial Tribunal, Bangalore, in this regard. Both
parties have also agreed that benefits extended by the Management and the
Management Proposals conceded by the Union, together forms a 'package deal
and hence accept that they are inseparable.

In return, as provided therein, the MEA agreed to call-off the strike and end all
agitation. Accordingly, the indefinite strike was called off by the Union, and
Workmen have restored normalcy of working w.e.f., | shift of 28.06.03. Further,
the Management and MEA entered into a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) on 17.07.08, which is in full and final settlement of all the points raised
in the Charter of Demands submitted by the Union and Management
proposals made by the Management.

Whereas, in line with the said MOU, MEA expressed that it is desirous of holding
a fresh Referendum to elicit views of all workmen, whether to accept the settlement
benefits & management proposals as 'a package deal’ and sign The Memorandum
of Settlement or not. Accordingly, a 'YES' or 'NO' secret ballot Referendum
was conducted on 23.07.03, wherein a total 2632 out of 2827 eligible workmen
members exercised their franchise. A clear majority, i.e., 1576 workmen out of
2632 have voted 'YES' in favour of the Settlement.

Thus, after ascertaining the views of workmen through the Referendum, in the
tripartite meeting that was held on 24.07.03, before Shri Sanjiv Kumar,
1.A.S, Commissioner of Labour, Karnataka & Mr. C M Sitimani, Addl. Labour
Commissioner (Admn), with the aid, assistance and guidance from the Authority,
few differences that remained were also resolved to full satisfaction of the
parties. And whereas, the Commissioner of Labour and State Conciliation
Officer, Karnataka, is also fully satisfied that the settlement reached is fair
and reasonable.

The General Manager

Dear Sir,
Sub: Charter of Demands

You are already in receipt of our Notice of termination of Settlement, which
ended on 31.12.2000.

The Special General Body Meeting of our Association held on 01.03.2001 has
resolved among other things, to submit Charter of Demands for your perusal and early
start of negotiations.

You have consciously, to dampen the spirit and enthusiasm of workmen, stated in
your reply to our notice of termination, requesting workmen not to raise any demands
involving financial burden to the Company, so that the Personnel Cost may not go up.

In the Company, according to our information the Salary and perks of the
Executives and M & SS is more than the wage cost & welfare expenses of the workmen,
who are the real producers of wealth. We would like to point out that, the Wage and
Welfare Cost of workmen is just 8% of the total turn over and the rest is in your kitty.
Therefore it is not correct to state that, workmen should not ask for more
wages, since they have to bear the brunt of Government policies and escalating living
cost in maintaining their family.

Thanking you,

Yours faithfully
For MICO Employees' Association

Bosch Quality Principles

1,

Our goal is to fully satisfy our customers’ expectations
through the quality of our products and services.

. Quality and quality improvement is every associate's

responsibility and ultimate goal - from the board of directors
to apprentices.

. Our directives, processes, systems and goals are based on

requirements from international standards, customer
expectations, our knowledge and experience. Knowledge of
and compliance with these directives and processes is the
foundation of our quality.

. Quality means paying attention to the details from the

beginning, thus preventing failures in the end. Continuous
improvement of the quality of processes lowers costs and
increases productivity.

. Avoiding failures is more important than eliminating defects.

We systematically apply methods and tools for preventive
quality assurance, learn from mistakes and eliminate their
root causes without delay.

. Our suppliers contribute substantially to the quality of our

products and services. Therefore our suppliers must live up
to the same high quality standards we have adopted.

MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS - PART II

The parties to the settlement discussed in full detail, the fluctuation in demand for
company's various products, frequent recession faced by the automobile industry
and narrowing margins, in view of stiff local and global competition. In order to
continue to be economically viable in the medium/long term, it was agreed that
employee productivity has to improve, quality has to be maintained/further improved
and costs have to be controlled. With this in mind, it was agreed that both MEA and
workmen will also be more responsive to emerging challenges in the business
requirements. The parties arrived at the following specific steps aimed at further
strengthening the economic viability of company.

1.

Productivity Improvement:

1.1 It is agreed between the parties that the workmen and MEA shall work

b)

c)

to achieve a 30% increase in the overall productivity of BanW, with effect
from date of signing of the Settlement. For the purpose of implementing
productivity increase the wage period shall be reckoned. The productivity
improvement as herein committed will be achieved in manner elaborated
below:

It is agreed that a workman covered under Direct incentive scheme, shall
produce 30% more output quantities within the same standard measure
of time. For example, if a workman was producing 100 pieces in 100 minutes
VT, with the signing of this Settlement it is agreed that he will produce 130
pieces in the same 100 minutes VT. The scope and spirit of this concept
and analogy has to be understood and extended to all workmen covered
under other Incentive Schemes as well.

VT, which is known at present as the time issued in minutes to produce 100
pieces, shall be redefined from the date of signing of the settlement, as the
time issued in minutes to produce 130 pieces. For all purposes, including
process planning, machinery planning, manpower calculations, efficiency
calculations & incentive payment and efficiency calculations and so on, the
revised VT shall be reckoned.

Workmen covered under direct incentive scheme will thus note that the
Total Earned Hours (TEH) will be calculated in future based on VT divided
by 130 pieces. For ease of explanation and better understanding, all
current VTs with respect to all the operations existing as on the date of
signing of Settlement shall be divided by a factor of 1.3 and VTs will be
re-set on line. Or in other words, workmen in order to earn the same

33

=== PAGE 38 ===

e)

incentive, shall have to produce quantity that is equal to 30% or more than
that is being presently produced within the same Hours Worked for
Incentive (HW!) shift hours.

With regard to VT for various operations which may be determined
hereafter, MTM based method of fixing VT shall be followed with effect from
date of settlement. For operations where MTM methodology cannot be
principally applied, stop watch time study method’shall be followed. VT will
not be negotiated. It is agreed that 5 workmen representatives nominated
by MEA will be trained on MTM and stop watch time study based method
of VT determination.

There will be no other change in the existing direct incentive system for
calculation of efficiency, incentive earnings or determination of hourly rate
of incentive.

1.2) With regard to workmen covered under indirect incentive, the existing table

linked to Factory Average Efficiency (FAE), will be the basis for incentive
payment. To improve accountability of indirect workmen, performance of
each indirect workman will be evaluated once every 6 months by a
‘Performance Appraisal’ system to be introduced. Therefore, in future,
indirect incentive payable to an indirect workman will be linked to
FAE as well as his own performance evaluation ratings. In order to
improve productivity of indirect workmen, the indirect manpower shall be
reduced by 30%.

1.3) With regard to workmen covered by Setters incentive scheme, their

incentive earnings will continue to be based on the existing table linked to
'Group/Dept. Average Efficiency’ and as well as his own ‘Performance
Evaluation’ rating.

1.4) With regard to workmen covered under Differential Payment System

(DPS), it is agreed that the final output of workman will be divided by
a factor of 1.30 to determine the Performance Index (PI). Existing
payment table will continue.

1.5) With regard to workmen covered under Premium Incentive and UBIS,

the final output of the group shall be divided by a factor of 1.30 to determine
the Performance Index (Pl) and Machine Output Index (MOI) respectively.
Existing payment tables shall continue.

1.6) With regard to workmen covered under Performance Incentive Payment

34

=== PAGE 39 ===

System (PIPS) the existing manpower shall be reduced by 30% while
keeping other parameters the same.

1.7) It is understood and agreed that the productivity improvement as above
shall be achieved by workmen without compromising on the established
quality standards and without deviating from the safety procedures.

1.8) It is agreed that any workman who refuses to give the increased output
shall not be eligible to the benefits to which he is otherwise entitled to
under this Settlement. He shall also make himself liable for appropriate
disciplinary action.

1.9) Itis agreed that workmen shall qualify for the benefits under this settlement
only after achieving the agreed productivity improvement for a period of
consecutive 6 months, from the date of signing of Settlement.

The Union, on behalf of all workmen assures that they shall extend full
co-operation in achieving the agreed norms of productivity improvement
and co-operate in various other steps taken to control costs, in
consideration of the package of over all benefits extended under this
settlement.

2) Ancillarisation & Modernisation:

lt is agreed between the parties, that due to very high priority that needs to be
accorded to control of costs, there is a need to review company's 'make or buy’
options available, considering the ease of imports due to globalisation and the
latest technology goods available, to further strengthen ancillarisation policy.

The parties after detailed discussions, agreed to do away with the low
technology, low margin production operations and eliminate usage of
obsolete machinery/technology by way of outsourcing of processes,
operations, products/services, lines to enable the Company's approach
of modernisation with a view to meet the international standards of quality,
as well as, to optimise the costs to further improve its cost competitiveness. In
this manner, the parties agree that the Management shall continue to pursue
vigorously “ancillarisation/outsourcing” as one of the strategic options to
reduce the cost.

The existing practice of retraining and redeployment of workmen within
BanW, consequent to such ancillarisation/outsourcing will continue, in
consultation with the Union.

35

=== PAGE 40 ===

3) Outsourcing in Indirect Areas:
It is agreed between the parties, that considering the expertise available to

perform some of the routine but non-core activity and also with a view to
improve cost effectiveness and to enable company to focus on its core
competence, indirect functions like CAN, WSD, PTR, LOG, TEF, QSG etc.,
functions will be outsourced, gradually. Workmen in these areas will be
suitably re-trained and redeployed within BanW in direct areas in
consultation with MEA.

4) Flexible Deployment of Workmen:
lt is agreed that both workmen and MEA shall co-operate by being flexible
with regard to manpower deployment, redeployment and therefore, to that
extent the transfer procedure (vide settlement dated 07.08.1989) shall be
deemed to have been amended :

4.1 In the event of a less work load situation, the juniormost workman in the
operation, machine or line or within the W in which such excess has been
identified, shall be redeployed in another department, either within or
outside RC/RH area. The workmen shall not insist that only juniormost in
the department should be transferred.

In order to enable surplus workmen to have on the job training, RTA shall be
extended for 2 halves only. On this basis, workmen can be transferred within
the BanW according to the varying requirements of manpower.

4.2 Workmen, other than essential services, may be called to work on any Paid
Holiday (other than 5 National Holidays) to the extent required for fulfilling
production/dispatch targets.

4.3 In the event of less workload, 5 day working week shall be worked in any one
or more product range(s) or the entire BanW. With respect to such
Saturdays not worked by the Company, workmen will apply for leave in their
credit, if any, at the rate of one day for every two such Saturdays.

4.4 In the unfortunate event of continued recession, due to very low workload
position, if BanW has to be kept closed fully or partly for a block of not more
than 12 days, workmen will be paid salary/wage for 6 days and will apply for
leave in their credit for the balance 6 days.

4.5 'G' shift commences at 7.45 a.m. Coffee/Tea served at 8.30 a.m in the plant
is also being availed by the workmen deployed in | shift, which virtually has

made an unscheduled additional coffee break in the entire plant, resulting in

36

=== PAGE 41 ===

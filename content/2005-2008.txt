SHORT RECITAL OF THE CASE

The Management and the workmen of the Factory and offices of Motor
Industries Co. Lid., at Adugodi, Bangalore represented by the MICO
Employees’ Association, Bangalore had entered into a long term Settlement
dated 24.07.2003 under Section 12(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
and the Rules made thereunder and the said Settlement was to remain in
force and binding on the parties till 31st December 2004 and even thereafter,
until validly terminated by either party, by a notice as provided in The Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 & Ruies made thereunder.

MICO Employees’ Association, Bangatore (hereinafter referred io as “MEA")
terminated the above Settlement from the close of 31.12.2004. vide its letter
dated 09.11.2004 and thereafter, submitted a Charter of Demands vide their
letter dated 20.12.2004 to the Motor industries Co. Ltd., Adugodi, Bangalore
(hereinafter referred to as "Company"). A copy of the said Charter of Demands
is enclosed hereto and marked as Annexure I. The Management aiso
submitted a few proposals to MEA, aimed at improving the overall
competitiveness of the BanP & various offices situated in the complex, vide
their letter dated 09.03.2005. Copy of the said letter containing the
Management proposals placed as counter demands is enclosed and marked
as Annexure Il.

The Management explained that in the past few years, the automobile industry
nas undergone a significant change. New green field projects set up by the
globa! major players are able to enjoy tremendous cost advantage. There
have been sharp fluctuations in demands for its various products. Fluctuating
demands have resulted in under utilisation of Company's fixed assets during
parts of the year. Company can no longer depend on high volumes, as it did
in the past. This has necessitated the Company to take a re-iook at its existing
practices and policies. To remain competitive, the Company needs to reduce
its operation costs, improve quality and enhance empioyee productivity.

Management further explained that the demand for ‘inline pumps' which is
its main product has been falling steadily, with the implementation of EURO
!! & Ill norms. The plant is preparing itself with a progressive approach for
the manufacture of new generation products, which calls for heavy
investments. This will require a new work culture, on the part of workmen
and MEA

=== PAGE 5 ===

MEA after presenting the Charter of Demands has consistently argued that
tne workmen have been working sincerely, meeting both quantity & quality
parameters. They have co-operated in all aspects in the path of the progress
adopted by the Company. However, Workmen are put to severe hardships
financially, due to rising cost of living in Bangalore City. Further, MEA &
Workmen nave come forward to improve employee productivity by VT
Reduction / Productivity Improvement. They have also agreed to
accommodate some of the management proposals. Hence. the workmen
expect a ‘substantive increase’ in wages / salary & other benefits.

The Charter ot Demands placed by the Union and the Management Proposals
were taken Up for discussion threadbare, in a cordial atmosphere between
ine parties over many meetings, held between 09.03.2005 and 04.11.2005.
The Management made it clear that the Company cannot afford to pay such
high level of wayes as proved by region-cum-industry Comparison of the
Gost to Company (CTC) of workmen. unless employee productivity
improvement Measures were agreed to. Keeping in mind the huge
investments being made in the plant. the Management insisted that workmen
and Union has to show a fiexible approach towards achieving better results.
is aiso imperative that workmen further improve their man-hour utilization
on macnines per shift working.

The Union on the other hand expressed that Company has earned good
Mnancial results. It has a capacity to pay. MEA further have assured that the
workmen and the Union are always committed to improve tne overall plant
productivity, but the workmen should not be levied with unduly heavy burden
of work. With the present day high cost of living, Workmen are finding it
cifficult to meet their social responsibilities comfortably. The parties were
able 10 Giscuss various aspects and arrive at an amicable understanding in
respeci ci several of the demands raised by MEA, as weil as the Management

proposa's

In the meeting held on 30.08.2005, the Company made a substantial
improvement in their offer and increased the basket amount to Rs. 1250 per
mont) Ber Gapia, on cost to company basis, linked to accepted Management
Proposats and Cnarter of Demands. In the same meeting, MEA assured to
consider improvement of Employee Productivity through VT Reduction in
the next meeting scheduled to be held on 13.09.2005. !n spite of the

=== PAGE 6 ===

assurance, MEA in the meeting heid on 13.09.2005 failed to make progress
in respect of Productivity Improvement/VT Reduction. The matter appeared
to have hit a stand still, with both the parties sticking to their respective
stand.

Whereas, MEA went further and vide their letter dated 18.10.2005, serveda
notice of strike stating that if a substantial increase in the basket amount
was not offered to their satisfaction, workmen would go on Indefinite Strike
from 14.11.2005 and urged the management to consider the demands
reasonably. Further, Management vide their letter dated 27.10.2005 explained
the rational behind their position and urged MEA to desist from venturing
towards any agitation, and instead, requested MEA to come forward and to
continue bilateral discussions & negotiate in good faith, copy of which was
filed with the office of the Additional Labour Commissioner. Thereafter,
Management and MEA have held intensive bilateral discussions in meetings
held on 28.10.2005 and 02.11.2005.

However, there remained unresolved, a few differences on certain MEA
demands and management proposals. In the interest of industrial peace
and cordial relations, the Management vide their letter dated 03.11.2005,
sought the aid, assistance and guidance of Additional Labour Commissioner
(IR), Govt. of Karnataka, and requested to admit the matter into conciliation
and to commence the conciliation proceedings with a view to bring about a
fair and reasonable settlement between the parties. Meanwhile, Management
and MEA held further bilateral discussions on 04.11.2005 and have resolved
the few differences that remained unresolved, finally culminating into an
amicable understanding. The parties recorded the understanding reached
as minutes of the meeting dated 04.11.2005.

lt is agreed that the business scenario is fast changing and the degree of
competition is increasing aggressively on a day-to-day basis. It is mutually
agreed that all endeavours will be in the direction towards achieving profit
and Company's overall business growth and stability.

During the course of the meeting held on 04.11.2005, parties have agreed
in principie for a basket amount increase of Rs. 2,400/- (Rupees Two
Thousand Four Hundred Only) per capita, per month for workmen, offered

the details of benefits available to workmen under the settlement and
explained the distribution of the basket amount and gave details of
Management Proposals agreed by MEA and called for a General Body
Meeting of its members to be held on 11.11.2005, to discuss and approve a
resolution enabling the acceptance of the terms and conditions of the

attended by vast majority of workmen who after deliberations, unanimously
approved the terms and conditions of the settlement and thereafter MEA

# 33, "SHRAMAJEEV! BHAVAN" Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore - 560 030.

Dated : 20.12.2004
To:

The General Manager,

Commercial Plant Management / BanW,
Motor Industries Company Limited,
Adugodi, BANGALORE - 560 030.

Dear Sir,
Subject : CHARTER OF DEMANDS - 2005-2008

In continuation of our letter dated 09.11.2004 declaring our intention to terminate
the Memorandum of Settlement dated 24.07.2003 as per section 19(2) of the
industrial Disputes Act 1947, we have pleasure to state that we are herewith
enclosing our charter of Demands, as approved by the Joint Meeting of the Executive
Committee & General Council held on 03.12.2004 and the Special General Body
Meeting of MEA members held on 15.12.2004.

We wish to mention that during the years 2001, 2002, 2003 & 2004, the Company
has made giant strides in all parameters viz., production, sales, profit etc. Naturally
therefore, the workmen rightfully demand their share in the prosperity registered by
the Company. We are sure you will agree with us that the workmen also have
contributed for this situation.

Further, during these four years, the cost of living has gone up. The life style of
workmen have undergone a sea change. This requires more money.

In view of the above, we urge upon the Management to start negotiations on
our Charter of Demands without delay. We may say that the workmen of MICO have
nightmarish experience in respect of Settlement of Charter of Demands. These
have been punctuated by enormous delay, adamant and unreasonable stand such
that Industrial Relations have been wrecked leading to strikes.

We therefore, wish to say that this time we should be able to arrive at a mutually
agreeable Settlement to meet the just aspirations of the workmen without loss of
time.

Thanking you,
Yours faithfully,
for MICO Employees' Association

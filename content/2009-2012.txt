SHORT RECITAL OF THE CASE

The Management and the Workmen of the Factory and Offices of M/s. Bosch
Ltd., at Adugodi, Bangalore represented by the MICO Employees’ Association,
Bangalore (Regd.No.147) had entered into a long term Settlement dated
47.11.2005 under Section 12(3) read with Section 18(3) of The Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 and the Rules made thereunder and the said Settlement
was to remain in force and binding on the parties till 31** December 2008
and even thereafter, until validly terminated by either party, by giving a notice
as provided in The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (as amended) and Rules
made thereunder.

The MICO Employees’ Association, (Reg.No.147) No.33, “Shramajeevi
Bhavana”, Bannerghatta Road, Bangalore-560030 (hereinafter referred to as
“MEA”) terminated the above Settlement and submitted a fresh Charter of
Demands vide their letter dated 22.05.2009 to Bosch Ltd., Bangalore
(hereinafter referred to as the “Company”). A copy of the said Charter of
Demands is enclosed hereto and marked as Annexure I. Management also
submitted its proposals to MEA, aimed at improving the overall
competitiveness of Bangalore Plant, vide letter dated 17.09.2009. Copy of
the said letter containing the Management proposals placed on MEA &
workmen as counter demands is enclosed and marked as Annexure II.

The Charter of Demands placed by MEA and the Management proposals
were taken up for discussions threadbare, in a progressive and cordial
atmosphere, in around 29 meetings held on different dates between
17.08.2009 and 24.03.2010. During the discussions, Management contended
that the Company was already paying high wages as proved by Region-Cum-
industry comparison of the Cost to Company (CTC) of workmen. The company
also has been neutralising inflation by way of increase in Dearness Allowance
every quarter. However, higher wages could be affordable if employee
productivity improvement measures and other Management proposals were
agreed to by the Union. Keeping in mind the huge investments being made
in the Plant, the Management insisted that workmen and MEA have to show
a greater flexibility in their approach to achieve better results. It is also
imperative that workmen must improve their man-hour utilization on
machines.

MEA on the other hand expressed that though on CTC basis the figure looks
big, nearly one third of CTC is a variable component which has to be earned
by the workmen. Besides, actual purchasing power of money has gone down
due to high rate of inflation. The workmen have contributed to Company by
improving their output efficiency resulting in higher FAE. They said, though
workmen have benefitted from higher incentive earnings, it always remains
a variable component, which is not assured. MEA expressed that Bangalore
city has become very expensive and the workmen are finding it difficult to
make their both ends meet and fulfili commitments and social obligations.
MEA argued that Management has earned good financial results with
substantial profits and the employer has a capacity to pay. They further
assured that the workmen and MEA are always committed to improve the

2

=== PAGE 6 ===

overall employee productivity within possible limits. However, workmen
should not be burdened with too much additional work, which they may not
be able to cope with.

On 25.03.2010, the parties after reaching an amicable understanding with
the aid and assistance of the Additional Labor Commissioner (IR) and State
Conciliation Officer, Bengaluru, signed a Memorandum of Understanding.
As per the terms of understanding, it was agreed that a ‘YES’ or ‘NO’
Referendum shall be conducted by the Union to elicit the opinion of workmen
with regard to the signing of a Memorandum of Settlement based on the
Memorandum of Understanding reached taken as a ‘package deal’ of benefits
offered and Management proposals as accepted. It was agreed by both the
parties that they shall sign the Memorandum of Settlement, if majority of
the workmen vote ‘YES’ in favour of the MoU for signing the Settlement. If
voted ‘NO’ by majority of workmen, it was agreed that the Authority will
refer the matter for adjudication, following the prescribed procedure in this
regard.

Consequently, a Referendum was held on 01.04.2010 wherein, a vast majority
of workmen voted ‘NO’. In view of this development, the Authority could
have referred the matter for adjudication, as per the terms of the MoU.
However, in the overall interest of Industrial Relations, the Union decided to
dissolve the elected body and hold fresh elections to elect new set of union
representatives for which elections were peacefully conducted on 07.07.2010.

The newly elected Office Bearers of the Union on taking office, approached
the Management claiming that the workmen had elected them to ‘improve’
the overall package of benefits already offered and argued that workmen
expected an increase in the cash components of their earnings through a re-
distribution of basket amount. They also requested Management to resume
bi-partite discussions at the earliest in view of the prolonged delay in
settlement of the Charter of Demands. The Union also submitted a letter
dated 12.04.2010 with certain demands which were given by their Executive
Committee members, in addition to their earlier Charter of Demands.

The Management took a clear position that giving any more benefits will
cause additional financial burden and would be very difficult to consider,
unless the Union accept Management proposals of higher productivity and
consider other management proposals. As majority of workmen have re-
elected the Union, Management contended that it was a sufficient
endorsement of the fact that the ‘package of benefits’ extended as in MoU
was attractive enough to most workmen. However, taking into account the
sentiments of workmen, Management came forward to consider a few
proposals to result in improvement in the cash component by re-distribution
of the basket amount.

Several rounds of bilateral meetings were held in a cordial atmosphere
between the Management and the Union. In the meantime, surprisingly MEA
gave a Notice of Strike dated 16.09.2010, declaring of their intention to
commence an ‘indefinite strike’ w.e.f, 07.10.2010. The union called ail

3

=== PAGE 7 ===

workmen to boycott Sunday overtime working from 19.09.2010. Along with
the notice of strike, Union also submitted a fresh list of 17 demands to the
Management, in addition to the demands mentioned vide their letter dated
12.04.2010.

_In the meanwhile, keeping the bi-lateral discussions going on, the
Management simultaneously requested the assistance and guidance from
AdLC to take up the matter for conciliation and bring about an amicable
settlement. The authority held 4 rounds of conciliation meetings between
the parties. Finally, as there was no possible agreement in sight, at the request
of both parties, the authority filed a ‘failure report’ of his conciliation
proceedings dated 05.10.2010. In spite of the above, the Authority advised
both the parties to continue bi-lateral discussions and make efforts to reach
an amicable understanding. Authority also advised parties to maintain
industrial peace.

As advised by the Authority, Management and MEA held bipartite discussions
again on 06.10.2010, wherein a consensus could be reached on the issues.
Further, with the guidance and assistance of The Additional Labour
Commissioner (IR) and State Conciliation Officer, Bengaluru, the parties
reached an amicable understanding and the Authority recorded a ‘Summary’
of the understanding reached during the conciliation proceedings dated
06.10.2010. Consequent to the understanding reached, MEA vide its letter
dated 06.10.2010 withdrew their ‘indefinite strike’ planned from 07.10.2010
and also informed in writing the Authority and the Management of their
decision, in line with the resolution passed in their Executive Committee
meeting held on 06.10.2010.

The parties further signed a ‘Summary of Understanding’ recording the
Understanding reached on 07.10.2010 and thereafter signed an MoU on
15.10.2010 on the same lines, before the AdLC. It was further agreed, that
the parties would sign a Memorandum of Settlement (MOS) on or before
23.10.2010, after ascertaining the opinion of majority workmen members
through a Referendum.

Whereas, in line with the said MOU, MEA expressed that it is desirous of
holding a fresh Referendum to elicit views of all workmen, whether to accept
the settlement benefits and Management proposals as ‘a package deal’ and
sign The Memorandum of Settlement or not. Accordingly, a “YES’ or ‘NO’
secret ballot Referendum was conducted on 22.10.2010, wherein a total 2209
out of 2388 eligible workmen members exercised their franchise. A clear
majority, i.e., 1385 workmen out of 2209 have voted ‘YES’ in favour of the
Settlement.

Thus, after ascertaining the views of workmen through the Referendum, both
the parties ina tripartite meeting that was held on 25.10.2010, the Additional
Labour Commissioner (IR) and State Conciliation Officer, Bengaluru also
fully satisfied that the settlement reached is fair and reasonable, it was
decided to sign the Memorandum of Settlement, as agreed in the MoU dated
15.10.2010.

PART Il - MEA DEMANDS AND MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS

GENERAL INCREASE

With effect from 01.01.2009, all workmen on the rolls of the Company
as on 01.01.2009, shall be given a uniform general increase of
Rs.1642.25 (Rupees One Thousand Six Hundred and Forty Two and
paise Twenty Five only) per month. This amount shall be merged
with/treated as follows;

a) A sum of Rs.800/- (Rupees Eight Hundred only) per month
shall be merged with Basic Wage / Salary, as applicable to
an individual workman. However, this shall not result in
change of wage structure.

b) A sum of Rs.842.25 (Rupees Eight Hundred and Forty Two
and paise Twenty Five only) per month shail be merged with
and treated as ‘Personal Pay’ applicable to a workman.

All Inclusive Wage/Salary and Personal Pay will continue to qualify
for payment of Gratuity, Bonus/AHRA, EPF, Overtime and
Performance Allowance, as applicable but does not qualify for
incentive.

SERVICE WEIGHTAGE

All permanent workmen who have put in a minimum of one year
service as on 01.01.2009 and continue to be on the rolls of the
Company, as on the date of the signing of this Settlement shall be
allowed a uniform Service Weightage amount to be calculated at
the rate of Rs.20/- (Rupees Twenty only) for each completed year of
service as on 01.01.2009. This amount of Service Weightage shall
be merged with and treated as Personal Pay, as applicable to the
individual workman.

Personal Pay shall continue to qualify for payment of Gratuity, EPF,
Bonus/AHRA, Overtime and Performance Allowance, as applicable
but does not qualify for incentive.

INCENTIVE MERGED BASIC (IMB)

From the date of signing of this Settlement, it is agreed that an
amount equivalent to 15% efficiency will be set aside from the
existing incentive earnings of each workman and will be paid
henceforth as Incentive Merged Basic (IMB). This amount of IMB as


=== PAGE 11 ===

applicable to each individual workman shall be merged into / treated
as Personal Pay, applicable to such workman.

It is agreed that Personal Pay shall continue to qualify for payment
of Gratuity, EPF, Bonus/AHRA and Overtime as applicable but shall
not qualify for incentive. Accordingly, derivative benefit impact of
IMB shall be deducted and shown as earmarked towards EPF,
Gratuity and AHRA. Please see illustrative example given below.

Example : with respect to a workman in GO6 Category

IMB = 187.50 X 0.15 X Rs,57.70 X 1.25 = Rs.2028.52 (Rupees Two
Thousand Twenty Eight and paise Fifty Two only). After deducting
AHRA @ 25%, EPF contribution @ 10% and Gratuity@ 5% which
cumulatively works out to Rs.579.58 (Rupees Five Hundred and
Seventy Nine and paise Fifty Eight only), hence, the net IMB payable
shall be Rs.1448.94 (Rupees One Thousand Four hundred and Forty
Eight and paise Ninety Four only).

Incentive payment @ 15% efficiency Rs./ p.m

(including AHRA) = 2028.52
IMB = 1448.94
AHRA = 362.24
PF = 144.89
Gratuity = 72.45
Gross = 2028.52

it is agreed that IMB amount shall be computed considering the
individual personal grade and shall be merged into the Personal Pay
as applicable to him/her and it will be a part of the “All Inclusive
Wages/salary.

IMB will be applicable to all permanent workmen and payment of
IMB shall be based on the actual paid hours, subject to revised
individual efficiency being > 100% every month.

Impact of annual revision of Hourly Rate of Incentive on IMB due to
change in Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be reckoned.

INCENTIVE IMPROVEMENT SCHEME - DIRECT

The existing incentive scheme based on VT and individual efficiency
will continue.

Incentive Improvement Scheme (IIS) is aimed at improving factory
average output from the present level by improving team performance
and also to enhance the earning levels of the workmen and thereby,
motivating workmen towards achieving higher production. The new



=== PAGE 12 ===

proposal is designed to improve machine hour utilization, to foster
improved performance, achieve year on year improvement in
performance and optimum utilization of manpower and to result in
better workman accountability.

Scheme Modalities

From the date of signing of this Settlement, existing efficiency %
will be re-set for all purposes with a Base shift of 15% efficiency
downwards from the current level of efficiencies to accommodate
IMB.

Example:
Current Efficiency Revised Efficiency
(with Base Shift of 15%)
150% 135%
175% 160%
191% 176%
200% 185%

IMB: An amount equivalent to 15% efficiency has been added to ‘All
Inclusive Wage/Salary’ as IMB, as explained in Clause 3 above.

Additional Incentive Rate

It has been agreed between the parties that towards motivating
workmen to achieve higher man hour utilization and increased
output within the shift working hours in Direct areas and to give
an opportunity for workmen to earn more by producing more,
Additional Incentive Rates shall be operative, from the date of
signing of this Settlement, as explained below:

Average Efficiency of each Cost Centre taken from June, 2009
to November, 2009, will be considered as Reference Efficiency
(normal situation), considering that the period prior to June 2009
was below normal due to downturn in economy. This Reference
Efficiency shall be reviewed along with MEA and revised if
necessary in January of each year, considering the process
improvement, automation, merge / split / formation of new Cost
Centers etc., if any.

Additional Incentive Rates shall be operative from the date of
signing of this Settlement, after considering the improvement in
performance over and above the defined Reference Efficiency at
cost centre level, as detailed below:

=== PAGE 13 ===

| Cost Centre Efficiency Improvement | Additional Incentive Rate (₹) |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|                                   | 2010   | 2011   | 2012       |
| Reference efficiency + <5%        | —      | —      | —          |
| Reference efficiency + 5 to 9%    | 1.00   | 1.00   | 1.00       |
| Reference efficiency + 10 to 14%  | 1.50   | 1.50   | 1.50       |
| Reference efficiency + 15 to 19%  | 2.50   | 2.50   | 2.50       |
| Reference efficiency + 20 to 24%  | 3.00   | 3.25   | 3.25       |
| Reference efficiency + 25 to 29%  | 3.50   | 3.75   | 3.75       |
| Reference efficiency + ≥30%       | 4.00   | 4.25   | 4.50       |


For Studied VT areas, to derive the improvement in efficiency, a factor of 2
will be considered and additional incentive rate wil! be as above table.

Eg.,: If improvement in a Studied VT area at Cost Centre level is 8%
in Efficiency, then 8% would be multiplied by a factor of 2 and
considered as 16% improvement and correspondingly a uniform
additional incentive rate of Rs.2.50/- per saved hour will be reckoned
for incentive payment to all workmen working in that Cost Centre.

The above Additional Incentive Rate will be commonly applicable to
all workmen covered under Direct Incentive Scheme on the rolls of
respective cost center at all efficiency levels considering the
individual efficiency.

This Additional Rate is applied on total Saved Hours to compute
Incentive amount and will attract AHRA.

It is made clear that the above Cost Centre rate is applicable for
Direct workmen on Direct production activities only.

c) Performance Linked Payment (PLP)

It is agreed between the parties, that towards achieving synergy,
promoting team work and enhancing production at Value Stream or
at Product Levels, from the date of signing of this Settlement, an
additional amount shall be paid as below to workmen working in
Direct Incentive areas.

Average Quantity per man per shift is defined for individual Product
or Value Stream considering the actual output in the normal period
from June, 2009 to November, 2009, is treated as Reference Quantity
for a Product or a defined Value Stream.

Example: PE pumps /man/shift, Elements /man/shift, DVs /man/
shift etc.,


=== PAGE 14 ===

Performance Linked Payment will be payable after considering
improvement over the defined Reference Quantity/man/shift
measured at Product-wise or Value Stream, as the case may be and
rewarded as detailed below:

| Reference Quantity Improvement     | 2010 (₹/month) | 2011 (₹/month) | 2012 (₹/month) |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| < +2.5%                           | 0              | 0              | 0              |
| +2.5% to +4.99%                   | 50             | 50             | 50             |
| +5.0% to +7.49%                   | 100            | 100            | 100            |

For Studied VT areas, to derive the improvement in Quantity, a factor
of 2 will be considered and PLP amount will be same as above.

Example : If improvement in a Studied VT area is 7% in Quantity,
then the 7% would be multiplied by a factor of 2 and considered as
14% improvement and corresponding PLP amount of Rs.800/- p.m
will be reckoned for payment.

The PLP amount will be payable uniformly to all Direct workmen in
the respective Product Group or Value Stream, subject to revised
individual efficiency being >100%.

It is agreed that to qualify for PLP in any month, workman must have
actually worked at least 15 days in the month.

The Reference Quantities shall be reviewed and redefined every year
in January, considering the change in product mix, process
improvements, actual output etc. Wherever product mix exists,
standardized quantity will be considered to derive the quantities.

PLP amount does not qualify for AHRA or any other derivative benefit.

As agreed by both the parties, the financial impact accruing from
this PLP amount will not be reckoned from the basket amount
increase of the current settlement (2009-2012). However, it is agreed

11

=== PAGE 15 ===

that the impact of increase (if any) in PLP Rate Table shall be
reckoned from the basket for the next settlement period.

With the introduction of Additional Incentive Rate and Performance
Linked Payment schemes, the computation of Direct incentive
payment will be done on monthly basis.

INCENTIVE IMPROVEMENT SCHEME - INDIRECT

Incentive Improvement Scheme (IIS) is aimed at improving the
present level of performance of indirect workmen by improving
synergy, team work and participation in target fulfillment. It is also
to enhance earning levels of the indirect workmen and thereby,
motivating workmen towards higher production standards. The new
proposal is designed to foster improved performance, optimum
utilization of plant, machinery, manpower and to improve overall
accountability.

The existing incentive payment % table will be discontinued for all
indirect workmen. It is agreed between the parties that from the
date of signing of this Settlement, indirect incentive applicable toa
workman in a month will be computed based as per existing practice
on a uniform rate of 70% of applicable FAE in the previous month.

Example :
FAE = 191%
Indirect Payment % = (191-100) x 70% = 63.70%

IMB: In addition to above, it is agreed that an amount equivalent to
15% efficiency calculated on the personal grade of indirect workman
will be added after deducting the derivative benefits into ‘All Inclusive
Wage/Salary’ of all indirect workmen as IMB as explained in Clause
3 above.

INCENTIVE IMPROVEMENT SCHEME — DIFFERENTIAL PAYMENT
SYSTEM (DPS)

a) DPS incentive will be payable as per the existing system to
workmen covered under the Scheme at present. However, in
addition to the existing Quality Bonus of 8%, (@ maximum level)
13% is added to all Quality Index levels in the existing QB table.
Payment of Additional Incentive Payment (AIP) of 2.5% will
continue.

b) Additional Incentive Rate

it has been agreed between the parties that towards motivating
workmen to achieve higher man hour utilization and achieve
increased output within the shift working hours and to give an

=== PAGE 16 ===

opportunity for workmen to earn more by producing more, Additional
Incentive Rates shall be operative, as explained below :

Average Performance Index (PI) of each Cost Centre taken from
January 2009 to December 2009, will be considered as Reference
PI.

Additional Incentive Rates shall be operative considering the
improvement in performance over and above the defined Reference
Pl at cost centre level, as detailed below:

Applicable only for those workmen on the rolls of DPS shops.

Rs. / Hour

| Increase in PI at CC Level | Rate (₹/Hour) |

| 21 – 25                    | 7.50           |
| 26 – 30                    | 9.50           |
| 31 – 35                    | 11.50          |
| 36 – 40                    | 12.00          |
| 41 – 50                    | 12.50          |
| 51 – 60                    | 13.00          |
| 61 – 70                    | 13.50          |
| > 70                       | 14.00          |


The above Cost Centre rate is applicable for DPS payment %
only which is linked to Pl, considering improvement of Revised
Cost Centre Pl.

With the introduction of Additional Incentive Rate, the
computation of DPS incentive payment will be made on monthly
basis.

To accommodate IMB of 15%, Performance Index will be reduced
by 36 in line with direct area


=== PAGE 17 ===

Example:

Current Perfomance Index (PI)           Revised PI
204                                          168
186                                          150
166                                          130
111                                          75

IMB : Amount equivalent to 15% of Efficiency calculated on the
personal grade of each workman will be added into All Inclusive
Salary / Wage after deducting the derivative benefits as IMB, as
explained in Clause 3 above.

Further, to qualify for IMB, individual Performance Index should be
>100 every month.

INCENTIVE IMPROVEMENT SCHEME — PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE
PAYMENT SYSTEM (PIPS)

It is agreed that the existing system of payment of incentive for
workmen under PIPS will cease to exist. In its place, workmen will
be paid Performance incentive calculated at uniform rate of 85% of
the FAE in the previous month. However, the payment of the said
Performance Incentive is linked and based on revised Performance
Evaluation system as agreed and as given at Annexure III.

Example :
FAE = 191%

PIPS Payment % = (191-100) x 85% = 77.35% (linked to
monthly revised evaluation)

IMB : In addition to above, it is agreed that an amount equivalent to
15% efficiency calculated on the personal grade of each workman
will be added in to All Inclusive Salary / Wage after deducting the
derivative benefits as IMB, as explained in Clauss 3 above

INCENTIVE IMPROVEMENT SCHEME — SETTERS

Existing Setters incentive Payment table and evaluation linked
payment at 3% is discontinued. Instead, the Setters in Direct
Incentive areas will be paid @ Shop Average Efficiency in their
respective departments based on the HWI.

IMB: It is agreed that an amount equivalent to 15% efficiency will be
reduced from the incentive earnings of each direct Setter and shall
be paid as IMB after deducting derivative benefits as applicable to
other workmen. IMB shall be paid merged/treated as Personal Pay
applicable to individual workman. Details are same as in clause 3.

14

=== PAGE 18 ===

Example :

Shop Average Efficiency 185 %
Setter efficiency 185 %-15% = 170%
Setters Incentive Payment % = (170-100) = 70%

15% efficiency is reduced to accommodate IMB. Efficiency 170%
will be considered to derive Setters incentive and will be calculated
at personal grade. Setters are not eligible for Cost Centre Additional
Incentive rate.

INCENTIVE IMPROVEMENT SCHEME -— MONTHLY RATED EMPLOYEES

Existing system of payment of Performance Allowance to Monthly
Rated employees will be discontinued with immediate effect.
Instead, they will be paid Performance Incentive as in line with
Indirect Incentive System, as explained in Clause 5 above.

IMB: It is agreed that an amount equivalent to 15% efficiency
calculated at average grade shall be reduced from the Performance
Incentive and taken towards IMB. The amount wiil be merged into /
treated as Personal Pay applicable to individual workman, after
deducting the derivative benefits as applicable. Other details of IMB
are same as explained in Clause 3.

Example :
FAE 191%

Performance Incentive for MRE = 191% - 15% = 176%
MRE Performance Incentive Payment % = (176-100) x 70% = 53.20%

Efficiency of 176% will be considered to derive indirect incentive
for MRE.

incentive rates for MRE are as follows :

| Monthly Rate (MR) Category | Equivalent Hourly Rated Wage Category |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| MC1                        | G04                                    |
| MC2                        | G05                                    |

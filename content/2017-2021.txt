SHORT RECITAL OF THE CASE

This Memorandum of Settlement signed under Section 2(p) read with 18(1) of
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 read with Rule 59o0f Industrial Disputes
(Karnataka) Rules 1957 by and between The Management of Bangalore Plant
(BanP) and Bidadi Plant (BidP), of Bosch Limited (hereinafter referred to as
“The Company”) situated at P.B.No.3000, Hosur Road, Adugodi, Bangalore -
560 030 & Plot No. 42, Bidadi Industrial Area 2nd Phase, Sector I! Bidadi
Hobli, Ramanagar District - 562 109 and the Permanent Workmen of the
Bangalore Plant and Bidadi Plant, of Bosch Limited, situated at F.B.No.3000,
Hosur Road, Adugodi, Bangalore - 560 030 & Plot No. 42, Bidadi Industrial
Area 2nd Phase, Sector || Bidadi Hobli, Ramanagar District - 562 109
represented by the MICO Employees’ Association, (MEA) (Reg.No.147)
(herein after referred to as the Union), on this, the 15'* day of June 2019 at
Bangalore.

Whereas, The Company and the Union had entered into a Memorandum of
Settlement dated 08.12.2014 under Section 12(3) read with Section 1.8(3) of
The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the Rules framed thereunder and the
above said Settlement was to remain in force and binding on the parties till
315' December ee thereafter, until validly terminated by either of

=

=== PAGE 4 ===

the parties, by giving a notice as provided under The Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 (as amended) and Rules framed thereunder.

Whereas the Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) dated 08.12.2014 signed in
conciliation under Section 12(3) read with 18(3) of Industrial Disputes Act
1947 read with Rule 59 of Industrial Disputes (Karnataka) Rules 1957 came
to an end on 31.12.2016. Taking cue from the experience of inordinate clelay
in signing the earlier Settlements, the Management addressed a letter dated
10.01.2016 to Mico Employees’ Association (MEA), the Recognized Union of
the Company issuing advance notice and intimation of termination of Long
Term Settlement (LTS) dated 08.12.2014 with effect from close of business
hours of 31.12.2016. A copy of the said management letter is enclosed hereto
and marked as Annexure-i.

The Management requested MEA to submit its Charter of Demands and
commence the negotiations on both the Charter of Demands of the MEA and
the Management Demands in all earnestness and sincerity to conclude and
sign a Memorandum of Settlement well before 31.12.2016. In line with the
timelines indicated, a detailed Management Demands vide letter cated
25.04.2016 was given to MEA with a request to submit their Charter of
Demands to commence negotiations and conclude a new Long Term
Settlement before the expiry of the Settlement dated 08.12.2014. A copy of
the said management demands letter is enclosed hereto and marked as
Annexure-2,

After about three months, MEA submitted its Charter of Demands consisting
of 40 demands vide its letter dated 27.07.2016. Immediately thereafter, the
first round of bilateral discussion was held on 11.08.2016. A copy of the said
MEA Charter of Demands letter is enclosed hereto and marked as
Annexure-3.

After a comprehensive understanding of the Charter of Demands placed by
MEA and the Management Demands in a sequential manner, discussions
were held at length supported by facts and keeping in mind the Region cum
Industry data, the concerns of the workmen and the business imperatives of
the Management of the Company. In the course of bilateral discussions, the
representatives of the Company explained at length about the economic
scenario, business prospects and financial position of the Company. The
Company stated that consequent to change in emission norms, ‘the Diesel
Auto market has witnessed significant changes, and the demand and share of

diesel products oo has been declining day by day. The

=== PAGE 5 ===

Management explained that the market is witnessing rapid changes in
technology and the Customers are demanding excellent quality components
at reduced prices. It was made abundantly clear that the auto market in the
developed world is rapidly moving towards hybrid and electrification of cars
and India will soon follow suit. The Company also explained that the
expected migration to BS-VI emission standards by 2020 would significantly
affect some of the products that the company is producing in BanP and BidP
plants. It was further explained to the Union that due to this changing market
scenario, a significant number of permanent workmen would become surplus
by 2020. It was also categorically stated that the Company would consider
launching of new products, fresh investments and continued business only if
the Bangalore and Bidadi Plants are able to compete with other Bosch
locations in India and abroad and demonstrate the cost efficiency in the
operations as a cost competitive manufacturing location for continuation of

business.

Even in such predicament, where the Company is facing serious business
challenges leading to threat to its existence, the Management conimunicated
its willingness to negotiate and arrive at a Settlement on “win win” terms
keeping in mind the welfare aspects of the workmen and long term interests of
the Plant. The management also continuously communicated to MEA and the
workmen about the affordability and viability as the key factors for long term
sustenance of the business. In the course of the bilateral discussions, it was
made very clear that the revision / modification of certain benefits / wage
components / terms of settlement / allowances are essential components to
discuss as focus topics to remain competitive in the business. It was
reiterated that unless the Bangalore and Bidadi Plants emerge and remain
cost competitive / low cost manufacturing locations, future business would
remain a distant dream. The Company highlighted business imperative and
need of hour to conclude an affordable Settlement to secure the future of the
Company and the workmen.

After threadbare discussions, the Company identified a few vital issues and
offered Basket amount of INR 4000 subject to MEA agreeing to the Rate of
neutralization of VDA at Rs.1.50 per point, No CPI benefit on Incentive Rate,
IMB, ABP, CPI on ABP, Elimination of additional 15% auto time. allowance,
Staggered basket, Lump sum death relief compensation and benéfits of the
Settlement with prospective effect. The Company also made it clear that the
basket offer is made on “Package Deal” basis, which would be valid only if
MEA agrees to all the above Management Demands. If no Management
Demands are ee the Package Offer made stands withdrawn.

ae ae

=== PAGE 6 ===

Despite giving a clear business perspective and prospects, MEA did not come
forward with a positive approach but remained adamant on its demand for a
basket of more than Rs.8,500/- (Rupees Eight Thousand Five Hundred oniy)
without making any progress in accepting Management demands. Even after
appreciating and understanding the business constraints, the MEA remained
adamant and set a condition precedent that they would discuss with the
Management, only if the basket offer is more than Rs.8,500/- (Rupees Eight
Thousand Five Hundred only) is made. Despite 16 rounds of bilateral
discussions, there was no progress. Per contra, MEA in the meeting held on
31.07.2017, submitted its proposal with a demand of a CTC increase of
Rs.27,156/- (Rupees Twenty Seven Thousand One Hundred Fifty Six only)
approx. per month by the end of the fourth year of the Settlernent period,
which was not at all affordable.

When the matter stood thus, the MEA issued a letter dated 14.08.2017 listing
out the agitation activities to pressurize the Management to concede to its

demands.

The Management addressed a letter dated 22.05.2017 to Additional Labour
Commissioner requesting for his intervention and to admit the matter in
conciliation and initiate the process of conciliation as provided under the
provisions of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and prevail upon MEA and the
workmen to enter into a Settlement at the earliest in the interest of industria!
peace and harmony in the long term interests of the Plant and the workmen.
The Management also requested upon the Additional Labor Commissioner to
prevail upon MEA to call off the Strike. However, MEA remained adamant.
Additional Labor Commissioner advised MEA to continue the bilateral
discussions on alternate day basis to arrive at a solution at the earliest. The
Management vide its letter dated 17.08.2017 informed MEA that such strike
would be not only illegal but also unjustified. The management advised MEA
that frequently resorting to such direct action, would make BanP & BidP
“unreliable plant” and will not be able to retain the trust of customers and other
stakeholders. The Management advised MEA to desist from resorting to such
direct actions, but come forward to negotiate and conclude the settlement
without further delay as such actions may compel Management to initiate
action as per the law of the land. MEA remained adamant and all the
workmen and MEA resorted to One-day Strike in all the four shifts on
30.08.2017.

Despite the strike by MEA, the Management continued to engage with MEA in
constant dialogue and discussions. Ultimately, wiser counsel prevailed and

=== PAGE 7 ===

MEA unconditionally suspended all its agitations with a view to continue the
negotiations and communicated the same vide its letter dated 19.09.2017. In
the course of discussions, MEA stated they are not willing to discuss about
any of the vital issues given by the Management but only in the interest of
concluding the settlement, they are prepared to discuss about Delinking of
CPI impact on incentive rate if the loss sustained by the workmen is
compensated. The Management demanded delinking of CPI impact on
Incentive Rate, IMB, ABP & CPI on ABP, since CPI impact was already
getting neutralized separately by Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA). Also,
in lieu of delinking CPI Impact on Incentive Rate, IMB, ABP & CPI on ABP,
Management offered to pay an additional incentive rate and also a
contribution of a fixed amount into LIC pension fund. The Management stated
that without demonstrating improvement in productivity MEA cannot ask for
any increases.

In the meantime, as the tenure of the Office Bearers of MEA ended, elections
to choose new MEA Office Bearers, Executive Committee & General Council
were to be held by April 2018. Elections were held on 05.04.2018 and the
Negotiations with the new team of Office Bearers of MEA resumed on
17.05.2018.

The Charter of Demands submitted by MEA and the Management Demands
placed by the Company were further taken up for intensive and threadbare
discussions which were sometimes acrimonious. In all, 55 rounds of
discussions (Eg: 47 rounds of bilateral and 8 rounds of conciliation meetings )
have taken place between 11.08.2016 and 06.11.2018 on various dates.

It is pertinent to note that the Company in BanP and BidP is a good pay
master and the average current CTC per month per permanent workmen is at
around INR.84,000/-. It is imperative and necessary that the Union agrees to
the management demands, which includes changing certain existing terrs
and conditions like delinking of CPI impact on incentive Rate, IMB, ABP and
CPI on ABP (since VDA is already being separately paid), a staggered and
prospective settlement in line with industry practice, revision of neutralization
rate per CPI point, modification of certain concessions in standard operating
time computation and other demands.

Further, the basket offered by the company will also be linked to productivity
increase to make the plant viable, ensure full utilization of men and machines
and to remain competitive.

=== PAGE 8 ===

After hearing the Management's views, the Union argued that the economic
position of the country and the industry will be bright in the future and they do
not share the fear of the Management.

MEA contended that the purchasing power of money has gone :down due to
high rate of inflation and though the workmen have been benefitted from
higher incentive earnings, it had always remained a variable component,
which is not assured. MEA further assured that the workmen and MEA are
always committed to improve the overall employee productivity and urged that
the workmen should not be burdened with too much additional work, which
they may not be able to cope with.

After many days of protracted, intense and sometimes acrimonious
negotiations, the parties arrived at certain broad terms of understanding «and
the same was recorded and signed as “Memorandum of Understanding”
(MoU) on 20.11.2018.

On 20.11.2018, the MEA submitted a letter to the Company that a
Referendum would be held on 24.11.2018 to elicit the opinion of workmen
members with regard to the signing of a Memorandum of Settlement based on
the Memorandum of Understanding reached on 20.11.2018.

Whereas, MEA distributed detailed pamphlet dated 21.11.2018, outlining the
benefits offered and the Management proposals accepted by MEA as
recorded in the form of Memorandum of Understanding. Referendurn was
conducted asking MEA members ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ through secret ballot EVM,
referendum on 24.11.2018 to elicit the opinion of the workmen members and
for obtaining their affirmative consent for the Office Bearers of MEA, to go
ahead with the signing of the Memorandum of Settlement.

Whereas, in the secret ballot Referendum conducted by MEA on 24.11.2018,
wherein vast majority of the workmen voted ‘No’. Whereas, MEA submitted a
letter dated 30.11.2018 informing the management that in their Executive
Committee Meeting held on 29.11.2018 have passed a resolution to contiriue
the discussion and renegotiate with Management in view of the rejection of
the MoU signed earlier and finalize Long Term Wage Settlement at the
earliest. The copy of the letter of MEA dated 30.11.2018 enclosed as
Annexure-4.

=== PAGE 9 ===

Whereas, after the referendum, in order to clarify / eliminate misinterpretatian
the Management vide its notice dated 04.03.2019 explained all the points of
the MoU for the awareness and to bring clarity to all workmen.

Whereas, management agreed to renegotiate with a clear unclerstancings
that any renegotiation will be without any additional financial impact. Further,
management has also communicated that any renegotiation has to be with a
clear principle of ‘Give and Take’ as the offered basket amount and agreed
terms are more beneficial considering the affordability under prevailing market
conditions.

The Management and the Union commenced the renegotiation ‘and after
multiple rounds of discussions, the parties arrived at an understanding on tne
subject of elimination of additional time on auto allowance which was given as
a concession in the earlier settlement. This additional time on auto allowance
was concession and a deviation from Bosch |.E. Guidelines and therefore the
Management demanded the withdrawal of this concession as a part of the
settlement. This was agreed after lot of discussions and was a part of tne
terms and conditions of MoU signed on 20.11.2018.

Consequent to the rejection of MoU through the referendum held on
24.11.2018, the management instead of their demand in respect of elimination
of Additional time allowance of 15% on auto time agreed to consider an
alternate proposal for this settlement. As an alternate proposal, the
management and MEA agreed for SVT payment correction to improve the
Plant productivity.

Whereas, MEA distributed detailed pamphlet dated 22.04.2019, outlining the
benefits offered and the Management proposals accepted by MEA as
recorded in the form of Memorandum of Understanding dated 20.11.2018
amended to the extent mentioned above and under clause 05 of Part-II, of this
settlement. Referendum was conducted on 26.04.2019 asking MEA members

members and for obtaining their affirmative consent for the Office Bearers of
MEA, to go ahead with the signing of the Memorandum of Settlernent.

Whereas, in the secret ballot Referendum conducted by MEA on 26.04.2019,
wherein workmen again voted ‘No’ with a marginal majority. The percentage
of workmen who voted ‘Yes’ went up considerably from 3% in the 1%
referendum to 47% in this 2 referendum.

MEA further requested the Management to hold discussions on the
settlement. After multiple rounds of bilateral meetings, the management and
MEA agreed, in addition to the amendment relating to Additional time
allowance on Auto time as explained above, to increase the general loan ‘rom
Rs.1,50,000/- per permanent workmen to Rs.1,65,000/- per permanent
workmen with other terms and conditions of the loan remaining as per earlier
settlement.

In the meantime, the Government of Karnataka referred the Industrial dispute
no. Reference No. LD 14 IDM 2019 dated 31.05.2019 to the Indusirial
Tribunal. Since the MoU dated 20-11-2018 got rejected in the two
referendum, the said MoU was not acted upon. However, as far as the Order
of Reference No.LD 14 IDM 2019 dated 31.05.2019 referring certain alleged
dispute to the Industrial Tribunal, Bangalore is concerned, it was agreed that
this dispute was neither raised by majority workmen nor by the recognized
union. Hence, both the parties further reviewed, reconsidered and improved
the terms of MoU dated 20-11-2018. In this background, the parties agree
that there are no disputes between the workmen and management, hence the
Hon’ble Industrial Tribunal be informed of the same and pray that the dispute
be closed as not warranting any adjudication.

On 10.06.2019, the MEA submitted a letter to the Company that a Special
General Body meeting would be held on 14.06.2019 to elicit the opinion of
workmen members with regard to the signing of a Memorandum of Settlernent
based on the understandings reached in various meeting between the parties.
A pamphlet highlighting the understanding reached with the Management of
the terms and conditions was circulated by MEA to the workmen.

On 14.06.2019, the Special General Body meeting convened by MEA in line
with their Bye-laws was attended by majority of workmen. The highlights of
the Long Term Wage Settlement was placed before the special general body
meeting and after the deliberations a resolution was passed with
overwhelming majority of the workmen present in the meeting authorizing

=== PAGE 11 ===

MEA to go ahead and sign the Long Term Wage Settlement. Copy of the
resolution passed in the special general body meeting is enclosed as
Annexure-5. *

The complete and the finalized terms and conditions of the settlement is
brought out in this Memorandum of Settlement which will be final and binding

on both the parties.

The parties to the dispute namely, the representatives of the Company and
Office bearers of MEA met on 15.06.2019, to fine tune the Mermorandurn of

Increase in cost to be borne by the transport users = Prevailing rate
of diesel (-) Base price (Rs 68.53) (x) Total Kms operated in a month
(Divided by) Kms yield (Divided by) 2 (Divided by) No. of bus users

Kms yield :

Type of vehicle and Yield per liter of HSD:
50 seater bus = 4 Kms/Ltr

32 seater bus = 5 Kms/Ltr

28 seater bus = 5 Kms/Ltr

22 seater bus = 6 Kms/Ltr

18 seater bus = 6 Kms/Ltr

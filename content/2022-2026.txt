SHORT RECITAL OF THE CASE

The Management of Bosch Limited, Bidadi Plant, situated at Plot No 42, Bidadi
Industrial Area, 2" Phase, Sector II, Bidadi Hobli, Ramanaga District - 560 109
(hereinafter referred to as “The Company” and the Workmen of the Factory and
Offices of M/s. Bosch Limited, at Bidadi, represented by the MICO Employees’
Association, (MEA) (Reg.No.147) (herein after referred to as the Union) had
entered into a Memorandum of Settlement dated 15.06.2019 under Section
Section 18(1) of The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and the Rules framed
thereunder and the above said Settlement was to remain in force and binding
on the parties till 30° November 2021 and even thereafter, until validly
terminated by either of the parties, by giving a notice as provided under the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (as amended) and Rules framed thereunder.

Whereas the Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) dated 15.06.2019 signed
under Section 18(1) of Industrial Disputes Act 1947 read with Rule 59 of
Industrial Disputes (Karnataka) Rules 1957 came to an end on 30.11.2021.
Taking guidance of past experience of inordinate delay in signing the Long
Term Settlements, the Management proactively addressed a letter vide dated
11.10.2021 to Mico Employees’ Association (MEA), the Recognized Union had
given intimation of termination of Long Term Settlement (LTS) dated
15.06.2019 with effect from close of business of 30.11.2021.

The Management requested MEA vide its letter dated 11.10.2021 to submit its
Charter of Demands and commence the negotiations on both the Charter of
Demands of the MEA and the Management Proposals in all earnestness and
sincerity to conclude and sign a Memorandum of Settlement well before
30.06.2022. It was also requested to submit their Charter of Demands to
commence negotiations and conclude a new Long-Term Settlement at the
earliest which is at Annexure I.

MEA submitted its Charter of Demands consisting of 59 demands vide its letter
dated 17.12.2021, which is at Annexure Il. Immediately thereafter, first round
of bilateral discussion was held on 08.02.2022.

After a comprehensive understanding of the Charter of Demands placed by
MEA and the Management Proposals in a sequential manner, discussions were
held at length supported by facts and keeping in mind the Region cum Industry
data, the concerns of the workmen and the business imperatives of the
Management of the Company. There were 62 discussions taken place between
08.02.2022 and 31.07.2023 on various dates in peaceful, business-like
atmosphere. In the course of bilateral discussions, the representatives of the

\

LoS)

=== PAGE 6 ===

Company explained at length about the economic scenario, technological
advancement and its impact, customer demands/expectations, competition,
business prospects and financial position of the Company. The Company
stated that consequent to change in emission norms, the Diesel Auto market
has witnessed significant changes, and the demand and share of diesel
products in Auto market has been declining day by day. The Management
explained that the market is witnessing rapid changes in technology and the
Customers are demanding excellent quality components at competitive price. It
was made abundantly clear that the auto market is rapidly moving towards
hybrid and electrification of cars. The Company also explained that the
expected migration to TREM V emission standards by 2026 would affect
significantly for some of the products that being produced in BidP1 plant.

Even in such predicament, where the Company is facing serious business
challenges leading to threat to its existence, the Management communicated
its willingness to negotiate and arrive at a Settlement on “win-win” terms,
keeping in mind the welfare aspects of workmen and long-term interests of the
Plant. The management also continuously communicated to MEA and the
workmen about the affordability and viability of the business. In the course of
the bilateral discussions, it was made very clear that the downward revision,
modification of certain benefits, wage components, terms of settlement,
allowances, way of working, need for required skills, right man on the right job,
flexibility are essential components to discuss as focus topics to remain viable
in the business and tide over the present business crisis. Repeatedly, it was
reiterated that unless the Bidadi Plant emerge and remain cost competitive /
low-cost manufacturing location, future business would remain a distant dream.
The Company highlighted business imperative and need of hour to conclude
an affordable Settlement to secure the future of the Company and its workmen.
It was categorically stated that the Bidadi plant has to demonstrate cost
competitiveness, operational excellence and compete with other Bosch
locations in order to make it fit for future and survive in the competitive, dynamic,
everchanging market scenario.

It is pertinent to note that Plant BidP1 is a good pay master and the average
current CTC per month per permanent workmen is at around 106,000/- INR. It
is imperative and necessary that the Union agrees to the management
demands, which includes changing certain existing terms and conditions like
revision to incentive system, Maximum Job Value, a staggered basket and
prospective settlement, tenure of the settlement for 6 years, contribution during
block closure, modification of certain concessions in standard operating time
computation and other demands.

Q:

=== PAGE 7 ===

Further, the basket offered by the company will also be linked to performance
improvement to make the plant viable, ensure full utilization of men, machines
and time to remain competitive.

After hearing the Management’s argument, the Union acknowledged and also
argued that considering the rate of inflation and cost of living, management
should also take care of the workmen interest.

Considering all the above aspects and in the overall interest of the organization
and its workmen, both the parties after the protracted negotiations and
discussions have set their hands to sign the Minutes of Meeting (MoM) on
31.07.2023. Though the Union has signed the MoM on 31.07.2023, Union did
not conclude the settlement converting the MoM into Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) and later into Memorandum of Settlement (MoS).
Instead of converting the MoM into MoS, Union went ahead and declared fresh
elections for the new office bearers, executive committee and general councils
positions. Based on the request of MEA, Management has facilitated to
conduct fresh elections and accordingly election was conducted on 19.12.2023,
wherein a new set of office bearers were elected out of which one of the office
bearers continued from the previous committee. After the newly elected office
bearers assumed the office of Union, submitted a fresh charter of demands and
requested the management to conduct fresh negotiations. When the matter
stood at this level, Management has no choice but to withdraw all the offers
made in the MoM dated 31.07.2023. The same was communicated to Union
vide letter dated 18.04.2024 (Annexure - Ill) and displayed a notice to all
workmen vide notice dated 18.04.2024 (Annexure- IV).

Further, when the fresh demands of the union were unreasonable and not
affordable, Management decided to seek the intervention of conciliation
authority vide its letter dated 05.06.2024. Conciliation authority intervened and
conducted multiple rounds of conciliation meetings in his good office. However,
in the conciliation meeting dated 03.09.2024, both the parities could not arrive
at a common understanding and therefore the conciliation ended in failure.
Copy of the failure report dated 11.09.2024, is attached in Annexure- V.

Whereas, the Union has simultaneously approached the Labour Minister for his
intervention and Labour Minister called for a meeting between Management
and Union in his office on 09.09.2024. In the meeting called by the Labour
Minister, both the parties presented their standpoint and the Minister advised

an

nn

=== PAGE 8 ===

both the parties to have consensus and conclude the settlement as early as
possible.

Whereas Union again approached the management for discussion and
reconsideration of some of the points from their revised charter of demands
vide letter dated 04.10.2024 (Annexure — VI). With a view to maintain cordial
relations and to settle the long pending impasse, multiple rounds of meeting
were held from 23.10.2024 to 22.11.2024.

Finally, the management and union had protracted discussions on 22.11.2024
from 2.30 pm. to next day i.e., 23.11.2024 early morning, at around 6.30 a.m.,
in the said meeting all the points were discussed and agreed and finally Minutes
of Meeting (MoM) signed on 23.11.2024.

After signing the MoM on 23.11.2024, Union again requested the Management
to provide few clarification on certain points and management readily accepted
the same and accordingly, provided the clarifications with a view to proceed
with signing of MoU on this subject. In the meeting held on 03.12.2024, it has
been decided to go ahead with MoU. Accordingly, considering all the above
aspects and also in the overall interest of the organization and its workmen,
both the parties, after protracted negotiations and discussions have signed the
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 14.12.2024. In the mean time
Government of Karnataka, Secretary of Labour after having received the
conciliation failure report from AdLC (IR), Karmika Bhavana, framed the issue
and referred the matter to Industrial Tribunal for Adjudication wide reference
no.LD-IDM/588/2024/LD.DO.6.L.S. Dated 19.12.2024 and the copy of the
same is attached as Annexure — VII.

Post signing the MoU, MEA requested the management to facilitate the
referendum to elicit the opinion of MEA Members to sign the MoS in line with
the MoU dated 14.12.2024. Based on the request of the MEA, Management
has facilitated in conducting the referendum on 20.12.2024, wherein the
Referendum ended in a failure with YES: 383 NO: 592 Votes respectively, out
of the total number of polls voted (975). In view of this, as there were no
chances of converting above MoU dated 14.12.2024 into MoS and hence it was
decided to withdraw all the benefits extended in the above MoU and the same
MoU stood withdrawn which was communicated to Union vide letter dated
23.12.2024 (Annexure_VIIl) and information to all workmen vide notice dated
20.12.2024 (Annexure_IX).

Whereas, in the meantime, The Industrial Tribunal has registered the case
under ID 455/2024 which was referred by Government of Karnataka
consequent upon failure of conciliation in the ongoing LTS. The copy of the
notice received from the Presiding Officer Industrial Tribunal no. KABC15-
001937-2024 dated 28.12.2024 is at Annexure —X.

Subsequently MEA vide its letters dated 01.01.2025 and 06.01.2025 have
expressed to continue the LTS discussions and arrive at an amicable
settlement. In the meantime, MEA requested for formal meeting on 31.01.2025
to finally conclude the LTS discussions. On 31.01.2025, both the parties in the
meeting after protracted discussions with view to conclude the settlement in a
Win-Win situation, some of the points raised by the MEA were discussed and
concluded.

Subsequently, MEA submitted a letter dated 11.02.2025 indicating their
decision to conduct Special General Body meeting on 17.02.2025 to elicit the
opinion of members on signing of MoS (Annexure XI). Accordingly, MEA
conducted Special General Body meeting on 17.02.2025 wherein, the MEA
indicated through their letter dated 17.02.2025 (Annexure XIl) indicating that
they have passed a resolution with the overwhelming majority to sign the MoS
and conclude the matter.

Further it was agreed to sign a Memorandum of Settlement (MoS) under section
18(1) Read with 2(p) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 and Rule 59 of the
Industrial Disputes (Karnataka) Rules, 1957. Since the matter is already in the
Industrial Tribunal under case ref..455/2024, the MoS will be filed along with
the Joint Memo requesting the Tribunal to convert the same into an Award of
Industrial Tribunal. In view of this both the parties have agreed and sign the

Incentive Payment Scheme).

(2e) Abolition of Previous Systems:
As a result of this change, the IMPe (Indirect Monthly Performance
Evaluation), the De-linking of 7%, slab system for payment and the PIPS
system will all be abolished.

This new system aligns the incentive directly with individual performance,
providing a clear and simplified evaluation approach for workmen. The abolition
of previous systems i.e., IMPe, De-linking, and PIPS streamlines the overall
structure.

With this, the indirect incentive amount payable shall be as per the table at
Annexure-XIV which is inclusive of 25% of AHRA and computed for HWI based

December 2014 with regard to this topic shall remain unaltered.

6. IMB, ABP, and CPI on ABP Payment:

Further, it has been agreed between both the parties that to enable all workmen
to improve the performance and earn the benefit of IMB, ABP and CPI on ABP,
itis agreed that these above components will be paid to all workmen based on
the following scenarios:

Scanario#1: Once each incentive group achieving 100% efficiency level as
existing today.

Scanario#2: Once the hangar achieves greater than or equal to 106% average
efficiency level, all groups in that hangar irrespective of their efficiency level will
be entitled for these components.

Scanario#3: If the hangar average efficiency level is less than 100%, but if the
groups efficiency level is greater than or equal to 100%, such of those groups
which are greater than or equal to 100% efficiency level will be entitled for these
components. However, those groups which are less than 100% shall not be
entitled for these components.

Hangar efficiency: The performance will be assessed hangar by hangar. This
means each hangar i.e., H101 & H102 is considered independently for
calculating average efficiency together of all groups in that particular hangar
and determining whether above conditions are met for payment of IMB, ABP,
and CPI on ABP components. This shall be applicable from the date of
implementation after signing of this settlement.

7. Maximum Job Value (MJV):

Preamble:

Maximum Job Value is the content of job performed by the workmen and to
classify them under Basic skilled, Medium skilled, Skilled, Highly Skilled based
on operations being carried out. The job content consists of the level of skill
required to perform the tasks considering the complexity with control and
decision-making ability to meet the production requirements in line with NPC
guidelines.

In recognition of the ongoing transition to automation, Al, and robotics, and
considering the impact of the VUCA world and digitization etc. it is agreed by
both parties that the introduction of MJV in the plant will be undertaken. The
shift from manual work to more automated processes is leading to a diminishing
need for traditional skill sets, thereby necessitating a redefinition of the job
structure within the organization.

Methodology:

(a) As a result, all jobs, processes, and operations across all shop floors—
including indirect areas undergone an evaluation process. This evaluation has
been conducted based on established guidelines, including those from the
National Productivity Council (NPC). The aim is to assess the current/future job
and/or current/future skills required and classify them according to the following
skill levels:

> Highly Skilled
> Skilled

Medium Skilled
> Basic Skilled

Vv

(b) The objective of this classification is to ensure that all roles are aligned with
the future direction of the plant, enhancing productivity, efficiency, and workmen
growth, while also ensuring that skills and trainings are continuously adapted
to meet the demands of automation and digitization.

(c) Further to the above categorization of jobs/operations/processes, workman
shall be classified based on the operations that he is and willbe performing in
the department.

<a

ae

20

=== PAGE 23 ===

Ex: If person ‘A’ is performing ‘High Skilled’ job, then he shall be treated as
‘Highly skilled’.

If person ‘B’ is performing ‘Medium skilled’ job, then he shall be treated as
‘Medium skilled’.

(d) Because of reduced volume scenarios or deskilling of particular process on
account of automation or process change, accordingly workman skill levels will
be redefined. Under such circumstances, person who is working under that
process will be repositioned considering his/her skill sets, knowledge, attitude,
and performance.

Example:
In case, a particular process is ‘High skilled’ as per initial evaluation and then

the said process is revised as per the above changes and the resultant
evaluation is falling under the ‘Skilled’ category, the person who is working
under that process will be repositioned as ‘Skilled’ considering his/her skill sets,
knowledge, attitude, and performance.

(e) Due to the production requirement, if new positions are getting created ina
higher skill level than the available people, for filling the required position from
lower skill level to the higher skill level jobs, the same shall be filled considering
the skill sets, knowledge, attitude, and performance of workmen and after
imparting sufficient training.

(f) The operations will be re-evaluated as and when the changes are
incorporated or once in a year in Quarter 1, whichever is earlier, based on the
parameters such as automation, process improvement/reclassification,
job/activity reclassification, digitalization, ergonomic changes and/or any kind
of changes/improvements, the skill level of the job/s will be re-defined in terms
of MJV category.

Based on the availability of particular skill and knowledge of the process,
workman will be moved across the processes/jobs/operations/value streams in
case of high absenteeism / sudden change in demand / business requirements.
While moving workman, preference will be given to junior in the department
provided he/she possesses the required skill and knowledge of the process. In
the absence, whoever has possessed the required skill and knowledge of the
process shall be moved automatically.

MJV Allowance:

A new allowance called MJV allowance shall be introduced from the fixed
basket amount and shall get paid to all permanent workmen based on the skill
level of the jobs that they perform. This MJV allowance shall be applicable from
the date of implementation of MJV after signing of this settlement. The practice
of prorating of allowances as per Clause No. 11, Part Il, of the Memorandum of
Settlement dated 19.08.1998 shall be applied to this MJV allowance.

In case of person getting repositioned, the MJV allowance will also get revised
accordingly.

* For the purpose of MJV allowance an amount INR.100/- per month shall be
earmarked from fixed basket amount already agreed upon. This amount does
not qualify for AHRA.

This allowance also will be prorated as per Clause No 11, Part Il, of the
Memorandum of Settlement dated 19.08.1998.

If the workmen are re-deployed in a different operation with different skill level,
MJV Allowances will change to new skill level if he continues to work in new
operation for more than one month.

If the redeployment is less than one month, the MJV allowance shall continue
based on the previous station and skill level of the station.

With the introduction of MJV concept, the wage structure, existing practice of
granting annual increments, grading system (viz., G01 to G10) and time bound
promotions shall get abolished. Instead, the impact of abolition of these shall
be suitably added to individual Personal Pay. This Personal Pay will continue
to qualify for payment of Gratuity, Bonus /AHRA, EPF, Leave wages/Leave
encashment and Overtime only, as applicable, but does not qualify for Incentive
payments.

=== PAGE 25 ===

Individual workmen annual increment and time bound promotion related
increment will be calculated for the remaining years of service as and when
workmen are due for the respective amounts considering the eligibility criteria
as existing today. This will be effective from the date of signing of this
settlement and the same will be calculated considering the workmen would
have entitled for different increment rate at different time. This amount will be
paid year on year according to their corresponding eligible month of increment
i.e., January and July, every year.

Note: MJV will be implemented from the date of signing of the settlement as per
the above agreed MJV procedures.

8. Block Closure:

Considering the challenges posed by the VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex,
Ambiguous) world, the company recognizes that there will be instances when
business conditions necessitate temporary reductions in plant operations.
These conditions may include but are not limited to reduction in customer
orders, plant maintenance, upgradation activities, lean business seasons,
shortage of raw materials and/or reasons beyond the control of management.

Both the parties agreed to implement block closures in such scenarios. Below
are the terms and conditions related to block closures:

8.1. Block Closure
